      <h1>Hey, I'm Konstantin</h1>
      <p>And welcome to my first ever website.</p> </br>

      <h2>Why did you create this website?</h2>
      <p>I've created this website to tell you a little bit about myself.</p> </br>

      <h2>And who are you ?</h2>
      <p>I'm Konstantin Schlegel, I'm 17 years old (birthday 22.03.2001) and I live in germany.</p> </br>

      <h2>Why did you apply for Code Chrysalis?</h2>
      <p>I've been into programming for a few years now, mainly due to this private server stuff.</p>
      <p>And although I had lots of contact with very skilled developers before, I never really pursued it myself.</p>
      <p>But now that I've finished school and practically have all the time in the world, besides my internship of
        course,</p>
      <p>I've decided that I want to take this step.</p> </br>

      <h2>Why don't you just go study computer science?</h2>
      <p>From what I've read on the internet, Bootcamps teach you way more practical skills, which is much more useful.</p>
      <p>And it being in Japan, allowing me to live there for a few months, is an experience that is unmatched.</p>
      <p>Also my grades didn't allow me to.</p>
